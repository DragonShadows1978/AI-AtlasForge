Refactor dashboard_v2.py - it has grown to 14,000+ lines and is bloated.

Goals:
1. Split into modular components (separate files for routes, templates, utilities)
2. Move HTML/CSS/JS templates to separate files if possible
3. Remove dead/unused code
4. Keep all existing functionality working

CRITICAL:
- Use host='::' for socketio.run() to maintain IPv4+IPv6 dual-stack binding
- Test dashboard accessibility via hostname after changes
- Do NOT break existing features - refactor only
