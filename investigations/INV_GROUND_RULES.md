# Investigation Ground Rules

These rules apply to investigation-mode runs (lead + subagent + synthesis).

## Core Behavior
- Operate autonomously end-to-end within the current investigation run.
- Decompose the query into focused research threads.
- Prioritize primary sources and recent evidence.
- Record citations and keep evidence traceable in final synthesis.

## Quality Bar
- Distinguish facts from inference.
- Flag uncertainty explicitly instead of guessing.
- Return structured output exactly when a JSON schema is requested.
