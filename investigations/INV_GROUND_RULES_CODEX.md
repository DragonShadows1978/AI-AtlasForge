# Investigation Codex Overlay

Apply these rules for investigation mode when provider is `codex`.

## Autonomy
- Operate fully autonomously; do not ask for additional user input during an active investigation run.
- Complete decomposition, research, validation, and synthesis without interaction pauses.

## Research
- Use web-search-capable behavior for current information gathering.
- Prefer primary sources and cite URLs clearly in synthesis output.

## Output
- Keep structured outputs valid and parseable when JSON is requested.
- Preserve evidence traceability from subagent findings to final synthesis.
