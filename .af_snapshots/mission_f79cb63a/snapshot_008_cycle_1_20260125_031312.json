      "summary": "Successfully reinstated the terminal server on port 5002, restoring functionality that was lost after migrating from mini-mind-v2 to AtlasForge. The terminal server provides tmux-backed persistent terminal sessions accessible via WebSocket, enabling remote access from anywhere on the Tailscale network (verified at 100.127.159.40:5002). The implementation is based on FastAPI with comprehensive features including multi-tab support, split panes, session persistence, authentication, scrollback buffers, command snippets, broadcast mode, and shell history search.",

        "Identified the gap between dashboard references to port 5002 and no actual running server",
        "Ported and adapted code from deprecated mini-mind-v2 terminal dashboard",

      "lessons_learned": [
        "tmux-based terminal sessions provide excellent persistence across disconnections - sessions survive even server restarts",
        "FastAPI's native WebSocket support is more performant and cleaner than Flask-SocketIO for terminal applications",
        "Tailscale networks already provide encryption, so HTTP-only is acceptable for internal tools",
        "Functional testing with real tmux sessions is far more valuable than unit tests with mocks",
        "The atlasforge_tray.py and dashboard widgets already expected port 5002 - the infrastructure was ready, just missing the server"
