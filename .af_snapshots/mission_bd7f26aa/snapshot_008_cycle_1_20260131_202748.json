      "summary": "Successfully identified and fixed the investigation panel lockout bug in the AtlasForge Dashboard. The bug prevented users from dismissing completed investigation results or starting new investigations while a mission was running. The root cause was a two-part issue: (1) no dismiss mechanism existed to clear completed investigations from the UI, and (2) frontend state could become stale. The fix added a new `/api/investigation/dismiss` API endpoint, a `dismissInvestigation()` frontend function, and a dismiss button to the UI. All 19 tests passed (12 self-tests + 7 adversarial tests), confirming the fix works correctly regardless of mission state.",

      "key_achievements": [
        "Identified root cause: missing dismiss mechanism + potential frontend state desync",
        "Implemented POST /api/investigation/dismiss endpoint that moves completed investigations to history and clears current slot",
        "Added dismissInvestigation() frontend function that calls API and resets UI state",
        "Added dismiss button to UI that appears when investigation is completed/failed",
        "Verified fix works while missions are running (the original bug scenario)",
        "Passed 19/19 tests including adversarial scenarios (concurrent calls, corrupted state, rapid cycles)",
        "Red team analysis found 14 theoretical vulnerabilities, none reproduced in stress testing"
      ],
      "challenges_overcome": [
        "Initial hypothesis that backend was blocking investigations was incorrect - the lockout logic correctly allowed starting new investigations when current was completed",
        "The actual issue was UX: users had no way to dismiss completed results, creating perception of being 'locked'",
        "Concurrent access testing required careful state management to avoid race conditions"
      ],
      "lessons_learned": [
        "Always verify assumptions about where bugs originate - the backend lockout logic was correct, the issue was missing UX flow",
        "Investigation and mission systems are independent - the bug was purely in the investigation panel, not cross-system coupling",
        "Frontend state can become stale if WebSocket events are missed - dismissInvestigation() explicitly resets all relevant state",
        "Adversarial testing with concurrent calls is essential for state-management features"
