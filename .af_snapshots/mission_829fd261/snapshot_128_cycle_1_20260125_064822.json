All 66 tests passed. This cycle focuses on final production verification and cleanup.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nRun a complete end-to-end functional test using the actual atlasforge_conductor.py to confirm the modular engine works in production.\n\nPHASE 1: LIVE CONDUCTOR TEST\n---------------------------\n1. Run atlasforge_conductor.py with USE_MODULAR_ENGINE=true\n2. Create a test mission via dashboard or API\n3. Verify all stage transitions work without AttributeError\n4. Confirm mission persistence across controller restarts\n\nPHASE 2: REGRESSION CHECK\n-------------------------\n1. Verify legacy mode (USE_MODULAR_ENGINE=false) still works\n2. Ensure no breaking changes to af_engine_legacy.py\n3. Test switching between modular and legacy modes\n\nPHASE 3: DOCUMENTATION\n----------------------\n1. Create API migration guide if time permits\n2. Document the new modular architecture\n\nFILES MODIFIED IN CYCLE 1:\n- af_engine/orchestrator.py - Added backward-compatible properties and methods\n- af_engine/state_manager.py - Added mission_dir property and helpers\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n1. atlasforge_conductor.py runs without errors using modular engine\n2. Full mission lifecycle (PLANNING -> COMPLETE) works\n3. All existing dashboard functionality works\n\nPRIORITY: MEDIUM (core functionality already verified in Cycle 1)",
