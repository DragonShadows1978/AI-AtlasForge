All 51 tests pass across self-tests, adversarial edge cases, integration tests, functional tests, and conductor pattern verification.\n\nOBJECTIVE FOR THIS CYCLE:\nPerform final validation and close out the mission.\n\nTASKS:\n1. Run a quick smoke test to confirm the modular engine still works:\n   - Execute: python3 -c \"from af_engine import RDMissionController; c = RDMissionController(); print('OK:', c.current_stage)\"\n   - Verify no import errors or crashes\n\n2. Verify the feature flag is active:\n   - Execute: python3 -c \"import af_engine; print('USE_MODULAR_ENGINE:', af_engine.USE_MODULAR_ENGINE)\"\n\n3. Document completion status:\n   - All original error cases resolved\n   - API surface matches legacy controller for all conductor usage patterns\n   - Test suite comprehensive and passing\n\n4. Mark mission as SUCCESS and archive.\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Smoke test passes with no errors\n- Feature flag shows USE_MODULAR_ENGINE=True\n- No regressions detected\n\nFILES REFERENCE:\n- af_engine/orchestrator.py - StageOrchestrator with full backward compatibility\n- af_engine/state_manager.py - StateManager with mission_dir property\n- missions/mission_829fd261/workspace/tests/ - Test suite\n- missions/mission_829fd261/workspace/artifacts/test_results.md - Full test report\n\nTHIS IS A VALIDATION CYCLE - No code changes expected.",

      "summary": "Completed comprehensive API compatibility audit and validation of StageOrchestrator vs legacy RDMissionController. All 51 tests pass across 5 test categories: self-tests (16/16), adversarial edge cases (14/14), integration tests (3/3), functional tests (11/11), and conductor pattern verification (7/7). The three original error cases that triggered this mission have been fully resolved: mission setter, mission_dir property, and load_mission() method all work correctly.",
