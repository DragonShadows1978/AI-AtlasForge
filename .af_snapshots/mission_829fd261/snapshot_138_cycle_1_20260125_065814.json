All 66 tests pass (16 API + 10 conductor + 6 stage + 14 adversarial + 19 spec + 1 persistence). The StageOrchestrator now has 100% backward API compatibility with legacy RDMissionController.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nPerform final validation and mark mission complete.\n\nTASKS:\n1. VERIFY: Run test suite one final time to confirm no regressions\n   - python3 /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/missions/mission_829fd261/workspace/tests/test_api_compatibility.py\n\n2. VERIFY: Confirm USE_MODULAR_ENGINE=true is active and StageOrchestrator is being used\n   - python3 -c \"import af_engine; print('Modular:', af_engine.USE_MODULAR_ENGINE)\"\n\n3. OPTIONAL: Run a quick functional test of the conductor integration if desired\n\n4. COMPLETE: Generate final mission report and mark COMPLETE\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- All tests still pass (66/66)\n- No AttributeError when using RDMissionController alias\n- Mission can be marked complete\n\nFILES REFERENCE:\n- Orchestrator: /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/af_engine/orchestrator.py\n- State Manager: /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/af_engine/state_manager.py\n- Test Suite: /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/missions/mission_829fd261/workspace/tests/\n\nNOTE: This is final validation only.
