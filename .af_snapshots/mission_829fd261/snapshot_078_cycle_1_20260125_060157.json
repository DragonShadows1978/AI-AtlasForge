All 45 tests pass.\n\nOBJECTIVE FOR CYCLE 2:\n1. Run one final end-to-end validation through atlasforge_conductor.py\n2. Verify the modular engine works in production conditions\n3. Document any edge cases discovered\n4. Mark the mission as COMPLETE if all validations pass\n\nVALIDATION STEPS:\n1. Run the conductor with USE_MODULAR_ENGINE=true\n2. Execute a mini mission cycle (PLANNING -> BUILDING -> TESTING)\n3. Confirm no AttributeError or compatibility issues\n4. Write final mission report\n\nFILES TO REFERENCE:\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/af_engine/orchestrator.py (main implementation)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/af_engine/state_manager.py (state management)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/missions/mission_829fd261/workspace/artifacts/test_results.md (test results)\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- No runtime errors when using the modular engine\n- All conductor patterns work (mission setter, load_mission, build_rd_prompt, etc.)\n- Mission can be marked COMPLETE with confidence\n\nNOTE: If all tests pass, mark the mission as COMPLETE. The API compatibility work is done.",

All 45 tests pass including 17 self-tests, 14 adversarial edge case tests, 3 integration tests, and 11 functional tests against the live mission. The three original error cases (missing load_mission(), missing mission setter, missing mission_dir) are all resolved.",
