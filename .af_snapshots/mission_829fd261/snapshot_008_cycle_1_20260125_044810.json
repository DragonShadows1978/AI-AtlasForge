MINOR: Empty JSON file edge case - atomic_read_json returns {} instead of defaults\n\nCYCLE 2 OBJECTIVES:\n\n1. FIX EMPTY JSON EDGE CASE (if desired):\n   - Modify StateManager.load_mission() to merge defaults when loading empty objects\n   - Ensure mission_id always has a valid value\n\n2. COMPREHENSIVE END-TO-END VALIDATION:\n   - Run an actual mission through atlasforge_conductor.py with USE_MODULAR_ENGINE=true\n   - Verify all stage transitions work correctly\n   - Check WebSocket events emit properly\n   - Validate mission state persistence across stages\n\n3. ADDITIONAL ROBUSTNESS TESTING:\n   - Test cycle iteration (multi-cycle mission)\n   - Test recovery after crash/restart\n   - Verify analytics integration working correctly\n\n4. DOCUMENTATION:\n   - Update any internal docs about the modular engine\n   - Document the API compatibility layer\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- No AttributeError or property errors in full mission run\n- Stage transitions work identically to legacy controller\n- WebSocket events emit for dashboard visibility\n- All edge cases handled gracefully\n\nFILES TO EXAMINE:\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/af_engine/orchestrator.py (may need refinements)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/af_engine/state_manager.py (empty JSON fix)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/atlasforge_conductor.py (reference for validation)\n\nPRIORITY: MEDIUM (core functionality complete, refinements for robustness)",

      "summary": "Successfully implemented 100% backward API compatibility for StageOrchestrator with the legacy RDMissionController. Added missing methods (set_mission, reset_mission, load_mission), properties (mission getter/setter, mission_dir), and fixed process_response to handle None gracefully. All 16 self-tests pass and 13/14 adversarial tests pass.",
