All 45 tests pass:\n- 17 self-tests (API methods/properties)\n- 14 adversarial tests (edge cases)\n- 3 integration tests (conductor simulation)\n- 11 functional tests (live mission)\n\nOBJECTIVE FOR CYCLE 2:\nPerform final end-to-end validation by running a complete stage transition cycle through the modular engine.\n\nTASKS:\n1. Clear Python cache to ensure clean state:\n   - find /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null\n\n2. Verify USE_MODULAR_ENGINE=true is active in af_engine/__init__.py\n\n3. Run the existing test suite one more time:\n   - python3 /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/missions/mission_829fd261/workspace/tests/test_api_compatibility.py\n\n4. Verify stage transitions work end-to-end:\n   - Test PLANNING -> BUILDING -> TESTING -> ANALYZING -> CYCLE_END -> COMPLETE\n\n5. Document final validation results\n\nFILES TO REFERENCE:\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/af_engine/orchestrator.py (StageOrchestrator - verified complete)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/af_engine/state_manager.py (StateManager - verified complete)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/atlasforge_conductor.py (consumer - no changes needed)\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- Test suite passes with clean Python cache\n- Stage transitions work end-to-end without AttributeError\n- No property setter errors\n- Mission ready for production use\n\nNOTE: This is likely a validation-only cycle. If all tests pass, the mission can be marked complete.",
