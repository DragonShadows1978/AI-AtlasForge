All 45 tests passed, confirming 100% backward compatibility between StageOrchestrator and legacy RDMissionController.\n\nOBJECTIVE FOR THIS CYCLE:\nPerform final production validation by running an actual mission through the modular engine to confirm end-to-end functionality in real conditions.\n\nTASKS:\n\n1. PRODUCTION VALIDATION\n   - Clear any remaining Python cache files (__pycache__, *.pyc)\n   - Verify USE_MODULAR_ENGINE=true is active\n   - Run atlasforge_conductor.py with a simple test mission\n   - Confirm no AttributeError or property setter errors occur\n\n2. EDGE CASE MONITORING\n   - Watch for any edge cases not covered by unit tests\n   - Check logs for any warnings about missing attributes\n   - Verify WebSocket events emit correctly on stage transitions\n\n3. DOCUMENTATION UPDATE (if needed)\n   - Update any outdated API documentation\n   - Add migration notes if legacy code needs updating\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA:\n- atlasforge_conductor.py runs without modification\n- No AttributeError for any method or property\n- No 'property has no setter' errors\n- Mission transitions through all stages correctly\n\nFILES TO REFERENCE:\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/af_engine/orchestrator.py (verified implementation)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/af_engine/state_manager.py (verified implementation)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/missions/mission_829fd261/workspace/artifacts/test_results.md (test evidence)\n\nNOTE: This is a validation cycle. No new code should be needed unless issues are discovered during production testing.",
