      "summary": "Successfully researched and implemented agentic software engineering best practices into GROUND_RULES.md. The mission addressed the fundamental insight that AI agents manage files differently than humans - agents can efficiently handle 800-1200 lines per file compared to human limits of 300-500 lines. The implementation established modular monolithic architecture as the required approach, with clear guidelines for file sizing, module boundaries, context engineering, and testing strategies optimized for agentic workflows.",

      "key_achievements": [
        "Added comprehensive 'Agentic Architecture Standards - CRITICAL' section to GROUND_RULES.md (lines 222-340)",
        "Documented modular monolithic architecture as required approach with 4 core principles",
        "Created file size guidelines table comparing Human (300-500 lines) vs Agentic (800-1200 lines) limits",
        "Defined standard project structure: core/, adapters/, interfaces/, orchestration/",
        "Established 5 module boundary rules: Cohesion, Coupling, Data Ownership, Interface Contract, Dependency Direction",
        "Added context engineering principles optimized for agent workflows",
        "Integrated module-level testing strategy aligned with architecture",
        "Updated Workspace Structure section to reflect new module organization",
        "All changes validated with 13/14 self-tests passing and 0.80 epistemic rigor score"
      ],
      "challenges_overcome": [
        "Balancing guidance specificity vs. flexibility - resolved by providing concrete numbers (800-1200 lines) with clear exceptions",
        "Integrating new content without disrupting existing GROUND_RULES.md structure - achieved by strategic section placement",
        "Validating documentation changes through automated testing - created both self-tests and adversarial analysis",
        "Adapting human-centric software engineering literature to agentic contexts - synthesized 10+ research sources into coherent guidelines"
      ],
      "lessons_learned": [
        "Context is the scarcest resource for agents - file consolidation reduces context assembly overhead",
        "Modular monolith is the optimal architecture for agentic systems - microservices create too much fragmentation",
        "File size limits should be based on agent context windows (~100K tokens), not human cognitive limits",
        "Module boundary tests (cohesion, coupling) should guide split/merge decisions, not arbitrary line counts",
        "Testing documentation changes requires different approaches than testing code - spec alignment and edge case detection",
        "Anti-patterns section is critical - explicitly documenting what NOT to do prevents common mistakes"
