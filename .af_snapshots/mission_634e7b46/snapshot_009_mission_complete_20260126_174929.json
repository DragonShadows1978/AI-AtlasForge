      "mission_title": "Implement Agentic Architecture Validator and Auto-Refactor Tool",
      "mission_description": "Build a Python tool that analyzes existing codebases against the new agentic architecture standards in GROUND_RULES.md and automatically suggests (or performs) refactoring to bring files into compliance. The tool should: (1) Scan files and report size violations (over 1200 lines or under 200 lines), (2) Detect module boundary violations (cross-module data access, circular dependencies), (3) Identify 'utils.py dumping grounds' and suggest proper distribution, (4) Generate a compliance report with specific recommendations, (5) Optionally auto-refactor by consolidating small related files or splitting oversized files at logical boundaries. The tool should integrate with the AtlasForge dashboard to display compliance metrics in real-time.",
      "suggested_cycles": 3,
      "rationale": "The GROUND_RULES.md now contains clear architecture standards, but there's no automated way to enforce them. A validator tool would: (1) Make the guidelines actionable by providing immediate feedback, (2) Help migrate existing codebases to the new standards, (3) Prevent drift by catching violations early, (4) Create a feedback loop for refining the guidelines based on real-world application. This builds directly on the current mission's deliverables and provides practical enforcement of the documented standards."

    "final_report": {
      "summary": "Successfully researched and implemented agentic software engineering best practices into GROUND_RULES.md. The mission addressed the fundamental insight that AI agents manage files differently than humans - agents can efficiently handle 800-1200 lines per file compared to human limits of 300-500 lines. The implementation established modular monolithic architecture as the required approach, with clear guidelines for file sizing, module boundaries, context engineering, and testing strategies optimized for agentic workflows.",

        "Added comprehensive 'Agentic Architecture Standards - CRITICAL' section to GROUND_RULES.md (lines 222-340)",
        "Documented modular monolithic architecture as required approach with 4 core principles",
        "Created file size guidelines table comparing Human (300-500 lines) vs Agentic (800-1200 lines) limits",
        "Defined standard project structure: core/, adapters/, interfaces/, orchestration/",
        "Established 5 module boundary rules: Cohesion, Coupling, Data Ownership, Interface Contract, Dependency Direction",
        "Added context engineering principles optimized for agent workflows",
        "Integrated module-level testing strategy aligned with architecture",
        "Updated Workspace Structure section to reflect new module organization",
        "All changes validated with 13/14 self-tests passing and 0.80 epistemic rigor score"

      "challenges_overcome": [
        "Balancing guidance specificity vs. flexibility - resolved by providing concrete numbers (800-1200 lines) with clear exceptions",
        "Integrating new content without disrupting existing GROUND_RULES.md structure - achieved by strategic section placement",
        "Validating documentation changes through automated testing - created both self-tests and adversarial analysis",
        "Adapting human-centric software engineering literature to agentic contexts - synthesized 10+ research sources into coherent guidelines"
      ],
      "lessons_learned": [
        "Context is the scarcest resource for agents - file consolidation reduces context assembly overhead",
        "Modular monolith is the optimal architecture for agentic systems - microservices create too much fragmentation",
        "File size limits should be based on agent context windows (~100K tokens), not human cognitive limits",
        "Module boundary tests (cohesion, coupling) should guide split/merge decisions, not arbitrary line counts",
        "Testing documentation changes requires different approaches than testing code - spec alignment and edge case detection",
        "Anti-patterns section is critical - explicitly documenting what NOT to do prevents common mistakes"
