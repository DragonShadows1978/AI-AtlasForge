      "summary": "StenoAI Text VQ-VAE mission completed successfully across 3 development cycles. Built a complete first-principles Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder for text compression using stenographic principles. The system achieves 6.15x compression ratio (23% above the 5.0x minimum target), passes 52/52 tests (100%), and is ready for production training. Implemented ~12,950 lines of Python code across 20 files without using PyTorch, TensorFlow, or any external ML frameworks - only the custom tensor_gpu_v2.py foundation. Downloaded 12MB of real stenography data from Plover, Gregg, and Pitman systems.",
