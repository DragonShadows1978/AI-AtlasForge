      "mission_title": "AtlasLab Cycle 3: Distributed Discovery & Symbolic Regression",
      "mission_description": "Enhance AtlasLab with 'Inverse Modeling' capabilities. Integrate Symbolic Regression (e.g., using PySR) to discover new hypotheses directly from experimental datasets. Scale the simulation stage to use distributed computing for massive parameter space exploration. Implement a web-based interactive dashboard for real-time visualization of high-dimensional phase planes and simulation trajectories.",
      "suggested_cycles": 3,
      "rationale": "The current system is excellent at validating and exploring human-defined hypotheses. The next logical step is to give it the ability to *generate* and *optimize* hypotheses autonomously based on data, moving closer to a 'robot scientist' paradigm."

    "final_report": {
      "summary": "AtlasLab has been successfully developed as a robust, hypothesis-agnostic scientific research framework. Across two intensive cycles, we transitioned from a foundational state-machine to a sophisticated system capable of symbolic derivation, numerical simulation, dimensional validation, and structural matching against known physics. The framework now supports the entire scientific workflow: from initial formulation in YAML to the final synthesis of reports with embedded visualizations. It is specifically designed for physics research, with deep integration of dimensional analysis and reference libraries.",
