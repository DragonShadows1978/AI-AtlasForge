      "summary": "Established the complete foundation of AtlasLab. Implemented the core state machine (Formulation -> Derivation -> Simulation -> Analysis -> Integration -> Synthesis), the three mathematical engines (Symbolic, Numerical, Dimensional), the Knowledge Base (SQLite), and the CLI. Successfully verified the framework end-to-end using the Harmonic Oscillator hypothesis, confirming symbolic derivation, numerical simulation, and dimensional consistency checks. Added advanced features like Parameter Estimation and Phase Plane Analysis.",
