      "summary": "AtlasLab has been successfully developed as a robust, hypothesis-agnostic scientific research framework. Across two intensive cycles, we transitioned from a foundational state-machine to a sophisticated system capable of symbolic derivation, numerical simulation, dimensional validation, and structural matching against known physics. The framework now supports the entire scientific workflow: from initial formulation in YAML to the final synthesis of reports with embedded visualizations. It is specifically designed for physics research, with deep integration of dimensional analysis and reference libraries.",
