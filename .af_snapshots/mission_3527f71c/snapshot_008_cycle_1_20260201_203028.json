This cycle should: (1) Verify the heal_continuation() fix from mission_8aeaf2c2 persists healing state correctly when _advance_to_next_cycle() runs, (2) Add the missing /api/glassbox/missions/<mission_id>/healing-events endpoint to expose healing data through the dashboard API, (3) Capture dashboard screenshot showing the new healing events endpoint data, (4) Write final validation report comparing simulated vs live healing persistence. Reference: The healing pipeline mechanism was validated in simulation during cycle 1 - this cycle confirms the actual persistence path works in production.",

      "summary": "Built comprehensive test infrastructure for healing prompt pipeline validation. Created drift injection utilities, metrics capture modules, and integration test harness. Executed all tests: 8 unit tests, 1 integration test, and 12 adversarial tests - all passed (21/21). Validated that heal_continuation() correctly detects drift (48.7% similarity), generates healing prompts (+653 chars), and populates rde_healing_applied in mission state. Dashboard verification confirmed GlassBox API is working.",
