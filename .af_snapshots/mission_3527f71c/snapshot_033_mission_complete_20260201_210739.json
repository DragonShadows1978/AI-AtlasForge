      "mission_title": "Healing Event Dashboard Visualization",
      "mission_description": "Build a visual dashboard component that displays healing events in the AtlasForge mission timeline. The component should: (1) Add a 'Healing Events' panel to the GlassBox dashboard that shows mission healing history with timeline visualization, (2) Display healing prompts with syntax highlighting showing what concepts were reinforced, (3) Show alignment percentage trends across cycles with sparkline graphs, (4) Add hover tooltips showing full healing prompt content, (5) Create color-coded severity indicators (CRITICAL/SEVERE/MODERATE drift), (6) Include a 'replay' feature that shows the original vs healed prompts side-by-side. This builds directly on the healing-events API endpoint created in this mission and makes the healing data actionable for human observers monitoring autonomous missions.",
      "suggested_cycles": 3,
      "rationale": "The current mission validated the healing pipeline backend thoroughly, but the data is only accessible via raw API JSON. A visual dashboard component would make healing events observable in real-time during mission execution, helping human operators understand when and why cognitive drift is being corrected. This is the natural next step - we proved the mechanism works, now we make it visible."
    },
    "final_report": {
      "summary": "Successfully validated the complete healing prompt pipeline through a 3-cycle mission. Cycle 1 established the test infrastructure and proved the mechanism works in simulation (8/8 tests passed). Cycle 2 confirmed false-positive prevention by verifying that aligned missions don't trigger unnecessary healing (correct behavior). Cycle 3 completed the validation by implementing live drift injection and proving the production path works - when severe drift was injected, the healing system detected it (43.4% alignment), prepended a 639-character healing prompt, and correctly persisted rde_healing_applied to mission state. The API endpoint /api/glassbox/missions/<mission_id>/healing-events returns populated healing data, and Firefox screenshots captured visual evidence of the working system.",

        "False positive prevention - aligned missions were correctly NOT triggering healing (resolved by understanding this is correct behavior)",

        "Virtual display configuration - successfully used Xvfb display :99 for Firefox screenshot capture",

        "API endpoint verification + screenshot evidence provides strong validation proof",
        "The healing prompt contains specific alignment percentages and actionable recommendations (not just generic messages)",
