      "summary": "Successfully completed all three mission objectives: (1) Implemented time-based handoff at 55 minutes using TimeBasedHandoffMonitor class with threading.Event for efficient timeout detection, integrated with Claude Haiku for intelligent summary generation; (2) Moved ContextWatcher from /workspace/ContextWatcher/ to /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/context_watcher/ at the AtlasForge root and fully integrated it with atlasforge_conductor.py; (3) Created comprehensive README.md documentation for ContextWatcher (221 lines) and updated the main AtlasForge README.md to include ContextWatcher in the architecture diagram and feature list. The system now provides dual-detection handoff (token-based at 130K/140K thresholds AND time-based at 55 minutes) to prevent context exhaustion and timeout waste.",

        "Implemented TimeBasedHandoffMonitor class using threading.Event for efficient, non-blocking 55-minute timeout detection",
        "Integrated with Claude Haiku to generate intelligent HANDOFF.md summaries before session termination",
        "Created dual-detection system: token-based (130K graceful, 140K emergency) AND time-based (55 minutes)",
        "Moved ContextWatcher to AtlasForge root as a first-class module (/context_watcher/)",
        "Full integration with atlasforge_conductor.py including handoff callbacks and Haiku API calls",
        "Comprehensive test suite with 2,215 lines of tests across 5 test files",
        "Production-ready implementation: thread-safe, graceful degradation, bounded memory, stale session cleanup",
        "Environment variable configuration: CONTEXT_WATCHER_ENABLED, TIME_BASED_HANDOFF_ENABLED, TIME_BASED_HANDOFF_MINUTES",

      "challenges_overcome": [
        "Designed thread-safe timer mechanism using threading.Event instead of naive sleep() for cancellable timeouts",
        "Implemented proper handoff signal propagation through HandoffSignal dataclass with elapsed_minutes field",
        "Updated metrics format from '1:0' to '1:0:0' ratio to track graceful:emergency:time_based separately",
        "Fixed import paths in test files to work with production location instead of workspace copy",
        "Ensured backward compatibility - watchdog is optional (falls back to polling)"
      ],
      "lessons_learned": [
        "threading.Event is superior to time.sleep() for cancellable timeouts - allows clean cancellation without interrupting blocked threads",
        "Dual-detection (token + time) provides defense in depth - if one method fails, the other catches it",
        "Haiku is ideal for generating handoff summaries - fast, cheap, and produces quality contextual summaries",
        "Centralized singleton pattern (get_context_watcher()) simplifies integration across multiple modules",
        "Metrics tracking with ratios (graceful:emergency:time_based) provides operational visibility"
