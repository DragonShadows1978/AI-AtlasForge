    "continuation_prompt": "The objective for Cycle 2 is to expand the feature set and documentation of `tensor_gpu_v2.py` while performing high-level optimizations. \n\nTasks:\n1. **Feature Expansion**: Implement missing layers and operations, specifically `ConvTranspose2D` and `AdaptiveAvgPool2D`, ensuring they support both NCHW and NHWC formats where applicable.\n2. **Documentation & Usability**: Add comprehensive docstrings, type hints, and usage examples for advanced operations like `einsum`, `checkpoint()`, and `GradScaler` to improve developer experience.\n3. **Performance Profiling**: Use the built-in CUDA stream and memory pool tracking to identify bottlenecks during training of deep architectures (e.g., ResNet or Transformer blocks) and optimize kernel launch overhead.\n4. **API Alignment**: Audit the library for API consistency with PyTorch to ensure it serves as a robust drop-in replacement for common deep learning workflows.",
    "cycle_report": {
      "summary": "The first cycle focused on hardening the core autograd engine in `tensor_gpu_v2.py` by fixing critical logic bugs and securing the checkpoint loading mechanism. Key achievements include correcting gradient accumulation, fixing the backward pass for checkpointing, einsum, and chunk operations, and mitigating a severe RCE vulnerability in `load_checkpoint`.",

      "achievements": [
        "Corrected `Tensor.backward` to ensure gradients accumulate (`+=`) instead of being overwritten, which was a critical bug for multi-step gradient flows.",
        "Implemented `SafeUnpickler` in `load_checkpoint` to prevent arbitrary code execution from malicious checkpoint files.",
        "Fixed `checkpoint()` logic to properly recompute the forward pass with gradients and accumulate them back to the original tensors.",
        "Resolved an issue where `einsum` backward would silently swallow exceptions, and improved its path optimization caching.",
        "Verified all fixes with a 100% pass rate across baseline regression, adversarial, and property-based tests."

      "issues": [
        "Discovered that existing test scripts were masking implementation flaws in `checkpoint()`; the test suite was updated to provide high-fidelity verification."
