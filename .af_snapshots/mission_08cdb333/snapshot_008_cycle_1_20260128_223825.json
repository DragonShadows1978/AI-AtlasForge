      "summary": "Successfully integrated Context Watcher HAIKU invocation notifications into the AtlasForge Activity log. When the Context Watcher detects approaching context limits (GRACEFUL) or time limits (TIME_BASED), users now see a '[HAIKU] Invoking Haiku...' notification in the Activity log BEFORE Haiku is called for summary generation. This provides real-time visibility into the system's automatic handoff preparation. The implementation modified atlasforge_conductor.py with 2 strategic send_to_chat() calls, one for each handoff type that invokes Haiku. Emergency handoffs remain unchanged as they don't use Haiku. All 12 self-tests passed with 100% epistemic rigor score from adversarial testing.",

        "Identified correct insertion points in on_context_handoff callback (lines ~997 and ~1023)",
        "Ensured notifications appear BEFORE Haiku invocation, not after",
        "Maintained distinction between result messages (Haiku wrote vs HANDOFF.md written) for success/failure cases",

      "lessons_learned": [
        "Minimal changes (2 lines) can provide significant user visibility improvements",
        "Placing notifications BEFORE async operations (like Haiku calls) gives users immediate feedback",
        "Using existing infrastructure (send_to_chat) is preferable to creating new notification mechanisms",
        "Code structure analysis (verifying order of statements) is as important as behavioral testing",
        "Adversarial testing with epistemic metrics provides confidence beyond simple pass/fail results"
