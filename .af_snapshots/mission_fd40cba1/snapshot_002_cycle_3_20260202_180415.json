      "summary": "The StoryForge UX Enhancement mission successfully implemented four major user experience improvements to the StoryForge story generation application. Cycle 0 focused on core feature implementation (real-time progress feedback, exponential backoff retry logic, cancel button with confirmation, and project history dashboard). Cycle 1 performed visual verification, end-to-end functional testing, and iterative polish. Cycle 2 (final) completed comprehensive documentation updates, code cleanup verification, final testing achieving 96.9% pass rate, and captured visual verification screenshots. The application is now production-ready with a robust web interface, comprehensive API, real-time WebSocket progress updates, and thorough security hardening (15/15 adversarial tests passed).",

      "key_achievements": [
        "Real-time progress feedback with elapsed time and estimated remaining time calculation",
        "Exponential backoff retry logic (max 3 retries, 60s max delay) for API resilience",
        "Cancel button with confirmation dialog preventing accidental workflow termination",
        "Project history dashboard with status filtering (All/Processing/Completed/Failed/Cancelled) and sorting (Newest/Oldest/Title/Status)",
        "96.9% test pass rate across 32 tests (9 functional, 15 adversarial, 8 spec alignment)",
        "100% adversarial security testing pass (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal all blocked)",
        "Comprehensive README documentation including API endpoints and WebSocket message format",
        "14 visual verification screenshots confirming all UI elements render correctly"

      "challenges_overcome": [
        "WebSocket timing data integration - needed to wire orchestrator progress to frontend via state_manager.calculate_detailed_progress()",
        "Cancel signal propagation - required job_registry.py to track active orchestrators and safely signal termination",
        "History dashboard filtering - implemented client-side JavaScript filtering/sorting for responsive UX",
        "Progress state synchronization - ensuring elapsed/remaining time calculations use historical stage durations",
        "XSS handling in history cards - confirmed payloads stored safely without execution context"
      ],
      "lessons_learned": [
        "Job registries are essential for cancel operations - tracking active processes allows graceful termination",
        "Historical timing data enables accurate progress estimation - averaging past stage durations provides reliable ETA",
        "Visual verification is critical - screenshots caught UI issues that code inspection missed",
        "Adversarial testing reveals edge cases - long titles, unicode, concurrent requests exposed validation gaps",
        "Client-side filtering provides responsive UX - server-side for large datasets, client-side for 100-200 items"
