      "summary": "Successfully implemented auto-clear functionality for the investigation text box in the AtlasForge dashboard. When a user enters a query and clicks 'Start Investigation', the text box now automatically clears upon successful investigation start. The implementation adds a single line of code (`queryInput.value = '';`) in the success block of the `startInvestigation()` function, ensuring the input only clears when the investigation actually starts successfully (not on validation errors or API failures). The JavaScript bundle was rebuilt and all functional and adversarial tests passed.",

      "key_achievements": [
        "Implemented auto-clear with a single-line change, keeping the fix minimal and focused",
        "Placed the clear operation inside the success block to preserve input on failures",
        "Rebuilt the JavaScript bundle to deploy the change",
        "Achieved 100% test pass rate (5/5 functional tests)",
        "Achieved 100% spec alignment score in adversarial testing",
        "No JavaScript console errors introduced",
        "Preserved all existing investigation functionality"
      ],
      "challenges_overcome": [
        "Located the correct file and function in the bundled dashboard codebase",
        "Identified the proper placement within the success block to ensure correct UX behavior",
        "Verified bundle rebuild was required and executed it correctly",
        "Designed tests that verify both success and failure scenarios"
      ],
      "lessons_learned": [
        "UX fixes often require only minimal code changes when placed correctly in the control flow",
        "The success/failure branching in JavaScript API handlers is the natural place for conditional UI updates",
        "Bundle-based dashboard workflows require both source modification AND rebuild verification",
        "Adversarial testing revealed a minor rapid-click edge case that is mitigated by existing UI lockout logic",
        "Testing both positive (clears on success) and negative (retains on failure) behaviors is essential for form UX changes"
