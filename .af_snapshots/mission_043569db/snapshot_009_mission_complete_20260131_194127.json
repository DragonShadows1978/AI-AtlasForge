      "mission_title": "Keyboard Shortcut Support for Investigation Start",
      "mission_description": "Add keyboard shortcut support to the investigation input field. Users should be able to press Ctrl+Enter (or Cmd+Enter on Mac) to start an investigation without clicking the button. This follows standard textarea submission patterns. The implementation should: (1) Add a keydown event listener to the mission-input textarea, (2) Detect Ctrl+Enter/Cmd+Enter combination, (3) Trigger the same startInvestigation() function that the button uses, (4) Ensure the auto-clear behavior works with keyboard submission, (5) Add a visual hint near the input field showing the shortcut (e.g., 'Press Ctrl+Enter to start').",
      "suggested_cycles": 1,
      "rationale": "Adversarial testing in this mission revealed that keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter) do not currently trigger investigation start. This is a natural UX enhancement that power users expect from textarea-based inputs. It complements the auto-clear feature by providing a faster workflow: type query, Ctrl+Enter, input clears, ready for next query. Single cycle is sufficient as this is a well-defined, low-risk JavaScript enhancement similar in scope to the current mission."

    "final_report": {
      "summary": "Successfully implemented auto-clear functionality for the investigation text box in the AtlasForge dashboard. When a user enters a query and clicks 'Start Investigation', the text box now automatically clears upon successful investigation start. The implementation adds a single line of code (`queryInput.value = '';`) in the success block of the `startInvestigation()` function, ensuring the input only clears when the investigation actually starts successfully (not on validation errors or API failures). The JavaScript bundle was rebuilt and all functional and adversarial tests passed.",

        "UX fixes often require only minimal code changes when placed correctly in the control flow",

        "Bundle-based dashboard workflows require both source modification AND rebuild verification",
        "Adversarial testing revealed a minor rapid-click edge case that is mitigated by existing UI lockout logic",
        "Testing both positive (clears on success) and negative (retains on failure) behaviors is essential for form UX changes"
