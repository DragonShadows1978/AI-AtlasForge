Cycle 3 should focus on PRODUCTION VALIDATION and DOCUMENTATION:\n\n1. **Live System Validation**:\n   - Start the dashboard and verify conductor API endpoints work: GET /api/conductor/status, GET /api/conductor/metrics, GET /api/conductor/collisions\n   - Start a test conductor and verify the dashboard shows it as running\n   - Test the --check-status CLI flag: python3 atlasforge_conductor.py --check-status\n   - Test blocked startup when conductor already running\n   - Test --takeover flag gracefully restarts conductor\n   - Verify metrics are written to logs/conductor_lock_metrics.jsonl\n\n2. **Dashboard UI Enhancement** (Optional):\n   - Add a conductor status widget to the main dashboard showing: running/not running, PID, current mission, uptime\n   - Add a 'Restart Conductor' button that calls POST /api/conductor/takeover\n   - Display collision count from metrics\n\n3. **Documentation**:\n   - Write final mission report documenting the complete implementation\n   - Update HANDOFF.md if context is running low\n   - Document the new CLI flags (--takeover, --force-takeover, --check-status)\n\nFiles to reference:\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/atlasforge_conductor.py (integrated)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/dashboard_v2.py (integrated)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/workspace/ConductorTakeover/conductor_dashboard_api.py (API endpoints)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/workspace/ConductorTakeover/artifacts/test_results.md (93 tests passing)",
