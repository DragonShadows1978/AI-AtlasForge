The next phase is INTEGRATION into the AtlasForge system.\n\nRemaining work for Cycle 2:\n\n1. **Integrate into atlasforge_conductor.py**:\n   - Replace existing `acquire_conductor_lock()` with `acquire_conductor_lock_enhanced()` from conductor_integration.py\n   - Replace existing `release_conductor_lock()` with `release_conductor_lock_enhanced()`\n   - Add `--takeover`, `--force-takeover`, and `--check-status` CLI arguments\n   - Install enhanced signal handlers via `setup_enhanced_signal_handlers()`\n   - Call `update_conductor_state()` on stage transitions to keep lock metadata current\n   - Check `is_shutdown_requested()` in main loop to support graceful takeover\n\n2. **Integrate dashboard API**:\n   - Register `conductor_bp` blueprint in dashboard_v2.py\n   - Add UI widget showing conductor status (running/not running, PID, mission, uptime)\n   - Add 'Restart Conductor' button that calls POST /api/conductor/takeover\n   - Display collision metrics in the dashboard\n\n3. **End-to-end testing**:\n   - Test starting conductor normally\n   - Test blocked startup when conductor already running\n   - Test --takeover flag gracefully restarts conductor\n   - Test stale lock recovery after simulated crash\n   - Verify metrics are recorded in logs/conductor_lock_metrics.jsonl\n   - Verify dashboard shows correct conductor status\n\nFiles to reference:\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/workspace/ConductorTakeover/conductor_integration.py (drop-in functions)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/workspace/ConductorTakeover/conductor_dashboard_api.py (Flask blueprint)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/atlasforge_conductor.py (target for integration)\n- /home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/dashboard_v2.py (target for blueprint registration)"
