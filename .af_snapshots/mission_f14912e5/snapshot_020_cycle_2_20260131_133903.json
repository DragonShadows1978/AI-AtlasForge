      "summary": "Fixed critical bug where empty stdout with rc=0 was incorrectly treated as an error, causing false-positive mission halts after 3 consecutive empty responses. The root cause was line 1097's check 'if not response_text:' which evaluated True for both actual errors (response_text=None) and empty but valid responses (response_text=\"\"). The fix adds explicit handling for the empty-but-valid case before error checking. Additionally, a comprehensive CLI error logging system was built for decade-scale observability, with JSONL output format, jq-queryable entries, and integration at all 4 error handling paths in atlasforge_conductor.py.",
