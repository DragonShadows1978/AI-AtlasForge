      "summary": "Successfully diagnosed and fixed the Terminal Dashboard authentication bug. The root cause was a dynamic SECRET_KEY generation using os.urandom(32).hex() that changed on every server restart, invalidating stored password hashes. Two terminal servers were affected: AtlasForge Terminal (port 5002) and Deprecated Terminal Dashboard (port 8765). Both were fixed by changing to static fallback SECRET_KEY values and resetting the databases to regenerate admin users with correct password hashes. admin/admin login now works reliably on both servers and persists across restarts.",
