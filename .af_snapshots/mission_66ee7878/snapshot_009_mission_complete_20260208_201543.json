      "mission_description": "Implement a frontend interface within the main dashboard to consume the AtlasLab API. This should include a visual hypothesis builder, a real-time investigation monitor, and a visualization suite for rendering symbolic formulas (LaTeX) and numerical results (interactive charts).",
      "suggested_cycles": 2,
      "rationale": "With the API now stable and running on its own port, the natural next step is to provide a user-friendly interface to enable researchers to interact with the AtlasLab engine without CLI dependency."

      "summary": "Successfully implemented and deployed the AtlasLab API on its dedicated port (5011). The API provides a robust REST interface for the AtlasLab research framework, enabling symbolic manipulation, numerical simulation, and hypothesis investigation. It features strict input validation, adversarial protection, and comprehensive logging. The implementation includes a dedicated startup script and has been fully verified with functional and stress tests.",

        "Exposed AtlasLab core research capabilities via a secure FastAPI-based REST service.",

      "challenges_overcome": [
        "Resolved complex PYTHONPATH issues to ensure the `atlaslab` core package is correctly resolved by the API server.",

      "lessons_learned": [
        "FastAPI's asynchronous nature and Pydantic's validation models significantly reduce boilerplate while increasing API reliability.",
        "Decoupling research engines from their presentation layers (API/UI) simplifies the testing of complex mathematical logic."
