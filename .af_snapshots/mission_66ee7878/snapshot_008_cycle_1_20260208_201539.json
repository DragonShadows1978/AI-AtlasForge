      "summary": "Successfully implemented and deployed the AtlasLab API on its dedicated port (5011). The API provides a robust REST interface for the AtlasLab research framework, enabling symbolic manipulation, numerical simulation, and hypothesis investigation. It features strict input validation, adversarial protection, and comprehensive logging. The implementation includes a dedicated startup script and has been fully verified with functional and stress tests.",

      "key_achievements": [
        "Exposed AtlasLab core research capabilities via a secure FastAPI-based REST service.",
        "Implemented port-specific configuration (5011) to ensure seamless dashboard integration.",
        "Developed a robust validation layer using Pydantic to prevent malformed data and injection attempts.",
        "Created a standardized startup environment with `start_atlaslab.sh`."
      ],
      "challenges_overcome": [
        "Resolved complex PYTHONPATH issues to ensure the `atlaslab` core package is correctly resolved by the API server.",
        "Hardened the symbolic expression parser to handle malformed LaTeX and edge-case mathematical inputs without service disruption."
      ],
      "lessons_learned": [
        "FastAPI's asynchronous nature and Pydantic's validation models significantly reduce boilerplate while increasing API reliability.",
        "Decoupling research engines from their presentation layers (API/UI) simplifies the testing of complex mathematical logic."
