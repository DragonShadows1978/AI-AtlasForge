Stage transitions in correct order\n4. Tool permissions enforced via InitGuard\n5. Claude timeout with MAX_CLAUDE_RETRIES\n6. needs_revision returns to BUILDING\n7. needs_replanning returns to PLANNING\n8. cycle_budget respected\n9. Continuation prompts generated\n10. Mission completes when budget exhausted\n\nIf additional work is desired in the next cycle, consider:\n- Adding performance benchmarks for test execution time\n- Adding code coverage analysis integration\n- Creating CI/CD workflow file for GitHub Actions\n- Adding mutation testing to verify test quality\n\nAll core mission objectives have been achieved. The test suite is production-ready.",
