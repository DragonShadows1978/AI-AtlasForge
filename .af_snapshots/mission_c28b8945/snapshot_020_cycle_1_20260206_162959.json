    "continuation_prompt": "Cycle 2 Mission: Finalize and harden the `tensor_gpu_v2.py` autograd improvements in `/home/vader/Project Tensor` with emphasis on adversarial depth and test-strength closure. Start by reviewing cycle-1 artifacts in `/home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/workspace/ProjectTensor/artifacts/` and analysis in `/home/vader/AI-AtlasForge/workspace/ProjectTensor/research/analysis.md`. Keep the existing math fixes in `/home/vader/Project Tensor/tensor_gpu_v2.py` as baseline. Priority 1: eliminate adversarial timeout blind spots by running completed full-file and targeted adversarial evaluations (use targeted slicing workflow from `research/phase6_redteam_target_tensor_slice.py` if needed) and produce non-timeout evidence artifacts. Priority 2: raise mutation strength by killing the 6 surviving mutants via stronger boundary and behavior assertions in `tests/phase6_mutation_target_tests.py` and/or expanded regression checks in `/home/vader/Project Tensor/test_autograd_regressions_phase6.py`. Priority 3: run full functional validation end-to-end on real code paths (`python3 test_autograd_regressions_phase6.py`, `python3 test_phase5_integration.py`, `python3 test_tensor_gpu_v2_phase5.py`, `python3 test_phase4_features.py`) and confirm CPU+CUDA remain green. If any regressions appear, patch `/home/vader/Project Tensor/tensor_gpu_v2.py` directly and re-validate. Deliver updated `artifacts/test_results.md` and `research/analysis.md` with explicit evidence, remaining risks, and completion recommendation.",

      "summary": "Cycle 1 established and executed a full correctness-hardening workflow for `/home/vader/Project Tensor/tensor_gpu_v2.py`. The autograd math regressions were addressed in code (matmul backward shape handling, repeated-index scatter accumulation, stricter unbroadcast validation, dtype/device canonicalization and inference hardening, NHWC Conv2D dtype preservation, GroupNorm input validation). A new phase-6 regression suite was added and run on CPU+CUDA, with compatibility/integration suites re-run. Functional results are green (`test_autograd_regressions_phase6.py` 40/40, phase5 integration 6/6, phase5 compatibility 24/24, phase4 features 23/23). Property testing reported zero violations, mutation testing passed threshold (0.8723), and manual blind validation reported full requirement alignment.",
