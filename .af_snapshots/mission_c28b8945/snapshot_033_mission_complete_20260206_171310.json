      "mission_description": "Implement and validate direct fixes for the highest-risk adversarial findings now documented but out of scope for cycle-2 closure. Prioritize: (1) replace unsafe pickle checkpoint loading with a safe, schema-validated format and optional signature verification; (2) correct checkpoint backward chain-rule propagation by supporting explicit upstream gradients in `Tensor.backward`; (3) remove silent gradient loss paths in `einsum` backward by eliminating blanket exception swallowing and validating generated equations; (4) fix closure-capture bugs (e.g., chunk backward) and add regression cases for multi-output graphs. Re-run full adversarial, mutation, and CPU+CUDA functional suites, then publish before/after severity deltas and residual-risk report.",

      "rationale": "Cycle 2 achieved stability and validation closure, but full-file adversarial evidence still reports critical/high issues beyond current mission scope.

    "final_report": {
      "summary": "Across two cycles, the mission moved from autograd regression diagnosis to hardening closure. Cycle 1 established the baseline fixes in `tensor_gpu_v2.py` (dtype/device canonicalization, safer unbroadcast semantics, duplicate-index-safe gradient scatter accumulation, stronger matmul backward shape/dtype logic, NHWC dtype preservation, and GroupNorm validation), added focused Phase 6 regression/property/mutation harnesses, and produced first-pass evidence. Cycle 2 closed the remaining gaps: adversarial timeout blind spots were eliminated with completed full-file and targeted red-team runs (both non-timeout), mutation resistance was strengthened to 47/47 killed (0 survivors), and required end-to-end functional suites were re-run on real CPU+CUDA paths with all passing. Final evidence and recommendation were consolidated in `artifacts/test_results.md` and `research/analysis.md`.",
