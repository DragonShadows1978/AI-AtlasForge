      "summary": "Across two cycles, the mission moved from autograd regression diagnosis to hardening closure. Cycle 1 established the baseline fixes in `tensor_gpu_v2.py` (dtype/device canonicalization, safer unbroadcast semantics, duplicate-index-safe gradient scatter accumulation, stronger matmul backward shape/dtype logic, NHWC dtype preservation, and GroupNorm validation), added focused Phase 6 regression/property/mutation harnesses, and produced first-pass evidence. Cycle 2 closed the remaining gaps: adversarial timeout blind spots were eliminated with completed full-file and targeted red-team runs (both non-timeout), mutation resistance was strengthened to 47/47 killed (0 survivors), and required end-to-end functional suites were re-run on real CPU+CUDA paths with all passing. Final evidence and recommendation were consolidated in `artifacts/test_results.md` and `research/analysis.md`.",
