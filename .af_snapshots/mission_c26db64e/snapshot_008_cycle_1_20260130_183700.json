      "summary": "Successfully fixed the multi-cycle continuation bug in the AtlasForge Mission Control Panel. The root cause was in af_engine/orchestrator.py where the cycle advancement logic required BOTH a non-empty continuation_prompt AND should_continue_cycle() to return True. This meant if Claude's CYCLE_END response didn't include a continuation_prompt, cycles wouldn't advance even when budget remained. The fix inverts the priority: check should_continue_cycle() first, then if cycles remain, generate a default continuation prompt if none was provided. The fix was validated with 29 tests across 3 categories (unit, functional, adversarial) achieving 100% pass rate and an epistemic score of 100%.",

        "Identified root cause: conditional logic in orchestrator.py required both continuation_prompt AND should_continue_cycle() to be true",
        "Implemented fix that prioritizes cycle budget check, then falls back to default continuation if Claude doesn't provide one",
        "Added _generate_default_continuation() method that uses original_problem_statement with graceful fallbacks",
        "Created comprehensive test suite with 29 tests across unit, functional, and adversarial categories",
        "Achieved 100% pass rate and epistemic score of 100% in adversarial testing",
        "Fix is backwards compatible - missions with proper continuation_prompts work unchanged"

      "challenges_overcome": [
        "Traced data flow through modular engine architecture (conductor -> orchestrator -> stage handlers) to find exact bug location",
        "Identified that USE_MODULAR_ENGINE flag routes to af_engine/orchestrator.py, not legacy af_engine.py",
        "Handled edge cases: whitespace-only prompts, unicode nulls, corrupted state (cycle > budget), missing problem statements",
        "Ensured fix maintains invariant: current_cycle never exceeds cycle_budget"
      ],
      "lessons_learned": [
        "In conditional logic, order matters: check the controlling condition (should_continue_cycle) before the dependent condition (continuation_prompt exists)",
        "Always provide graceful fallbacks for AI-generated content that might be missing or empty",
        "Adversarial testing with edge cases (null chars, extreme values, corrupted state) catches bugs that unit tests miss",
        "Property-based testing (invariants like cycle <= budget) provides strong confidence in correctness",
        "The modular engine architecture with clear separation (orchestrator/state_manager/cycle_manager/stage_handlers) makes bugs easier to isolate"
