Implement caching for frequently accessed research findings to reduce redundant WebFetch calls.",

      "summary": "Mission fe131665 successfully resolved critical infrastructure, dependency, and testing gaps in the AtlasForge system. The mission achieved its primary objectives of fixing Docker configuration errors, adding missing production dependencies, and updating 15 legacy tests to align with current architectural shifts (specifically around Gemini support and tuple-based orchestrator responses). A critical syntax bug in the adversarial testing suite was also resolved. The final test suite pass rate was improved from 94.6% to 99.75%, with 408 out of 409 tests passing.",
