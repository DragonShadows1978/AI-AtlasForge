      "mission_title": "Add Cycle Analytics to Dashboard",
      "mission_description": "Now that mission cycles work correctly, enhance the dashboard to display cycle-specific analytics. This should include: (1) A cycle timeline visualization showing duration and key events per cycle, (2) Per-cycle cost breakdown showing token usage and API costs for each cycle, (3) Cycle comparison view to see how approach evolved across iterations, (4) Cycle history persistence so past missions show their full cycle journey. The data is already available in cycle_history - this mission would surface it in the dashboard UI.",
      "suggested_cycles": 3,
      "rationale": "The cycle fix enables multi-cycle missions to work properly, but the dashboard doesn't yet leverage the rich cycle_history data being collected. Surfacing cycle analytics would help users understand how their missions evolved, identify where time/cost was spent, and compare approaches across cycles. This is a natural extension that makes the cycle system more useful."

    "final_report": {
      "summary": "Successfully identified and fixed the mission cycle counter bug. The root cause was in the modular engine's orchestrator.py - the process_response() method was not calling advance_to_next_cycle() when transitioning from CYCLE_END to PLANNING stage. Added 10 lines of code (lines 300-312) to detect CYCLE_END -> PLANNING transitions and properly advance the cycle counter. All 39 tests pass including basic cycle advancement, multi-cycle sequences, edge cases, and property invariants.",

        "Verified fix handles edge cases: zero budget, None response, missing/empty continuation_prompt all handled gracefully",
