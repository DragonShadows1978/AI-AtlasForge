      "summary": "Successfully investigated and fixed the mission queue auto-start bug in the modular af_engine. The root cause was that the `_process_mission_queue()` method was not ported from the legacy engine (`af_engine_legacy.py`) to the new modular architecture (`af_engine/orchestrator.py`). When a mission completed, no code existed to check the queue and start the next mission. Additionally, the queue scheduler integration had a Flask context dependency that caused 'Working outside of application context' errors. The fix added ~360 lines of queue processing logic to the modular engine and removed the Flask dependency from the queue scheduler integration.",

        "Identified root cause: _process_mission_queue() method missing from modular engine",
        "Identified secondary issue: Flask context dependency in queue_scheduler integration causing 'Working outside of application context' errors",
        "Added _process_mission_queue() method (~180 lines) to StageOrchestrator - acquires lock, reads queue, processes next item",
        "Added _create_mission_from_queue_item() method (~180 lines) - creates mission directories, writes state, writes auto-start signal",
        "Modified update_stage() to call queue processing when transitioning to COMPLETE",
        "Removed Flask dependency from queue_scheduler.py by using io_utils.atomic_read_json() for direct file access",
        "Fixed two NoneType bugs found during adversarial testing (original_problem_statement[:50] and cycle_budget comparison)",
        "Achieved feature parity with legacy engine while improving robustness"
      ],
      "challenges_overcome": [
        "Flask context dependency - the queue_scheduler.py integration called dashboard_modules.queue_scheduler.queue_status() which used jsonify(), requiring Flask app context. Fixed by using direct file access.",
        "NoneType handling - dict.get() with default value still returns None if key exists with None value. Fixed by using 'or' pattern: (value or default)",
        "Race condition prevention - implemented proper queue processing lock to prevent multiple processes from claiming the same queue item",
        "Queue item format variations - handled both 'description' and 'problem_statement' fields, minimal queue items, dashboard format"

      "lessons_learned": [
        "When refactoring to modular architecture, ensure all functionality is ported - the queue processing was silently missing",
        "Flask-dependent code (using jsonify, current_app) cannot be called from outside Flask request context - use direct file/API access instead",
        "dict.get(key, default) returns None if key exists with None value - use 'or' pattern for true fallback: (dict.get(key) or default)",
        "Adversarial testing with None values, empty strings, and edge cases catches bugs that unit tests miss",
        "Log messages in the legacy engine (e.g., 'Processing queued mission:') serve as documentation of expected behavior"
