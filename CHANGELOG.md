  - System service integration (systemd)
  - Environment detection and generation

- **Documentation**
  - README.md with quick start guide
  - INSTALL.md with detailed installation instructions
  - USAGE.md with operational guide
  - ARCHITECTURE.md with system design overview
  - GROUND_RULES.md for autonomous agent guidance

- **Configuration**
  - `config.example.yaml` template
  - `.env.example` for environment variables
  - `ENVIRONMENT.example.md` hardware profile template
  - Centralized configuration via `atlasforge_config.py`

### Changed

- Rebranded from "RDE" (Research & Development Engine) to "AtlasForge"
  - All module names updated (rd_engine -> af_engine, rde -> atlasforge)
  - Dashboard routes updated (/api/rde/* -> /api/atlasforge/*)
  - Enhancement package renamed (rde_enhancements -> atlasforge_enhancements)

- Dashboard improvements
  - ES6 module system for JavaScript
  - Improved caching and performance
  - Enhanced error handling
  - Modular widget architecture

### Removed

- Legacy RDE naming and modules
  - `rd_engine.py` (replaced by `af_engine.py`)
  - `rde_tray.py` (replaced by `atlasforge_tray.py`)
  - `rde_enhancements/` directory (replaced by `atlasforge_enhancements/`)
  - `dashboard_modules/rde.py` (replaced by `dashboard_modules/atlasforge.py`)

### Security

- Hardcoded paths removed and replaced with configurable alternatives
- Secrets and credentials properly excluded via `.gitignore`
- File protection system for core components with automatic backups
- Dashboard import policy to prevent cross-mission contamination

### Notes

This is the initial public release of AI-AtlasForge, forked and evolved from the
mini-mind-v2 project. The platform enables autonomous AI agents to perform complex
software engineering tasks with minimal human supervision while maintaining
transparency and reproducibility.
